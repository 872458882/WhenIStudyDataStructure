Pride and Prejudice 

Jane Austen began her second novel, Pride and Prejudice, before she was twenty-one. It was originally titled First Impression because the appearances of the characters created the plot of the novel. However, because the novel is also concerned with the effects of the character's first impressions, that is their prejudice, Jane found the title Pride and Prejudice more appropriate.

Pride and Prejudice, similar to other Jane Austen's novels, is written in gentle or Horacian satire. The main object of Jane's satire in the novel is the mercenary and the ignorance of the people, a common criticism of the 18th century.
